Our vision led to the birth of NGT Academy in 2017. W e applied to AngelPad, a top startup incubator, and received our first investment of $50,000. Since then, we’ve grown to be a multimillion-dollar company. My journey has been an ever-expanding dream, once hoping to make just $16,000 a year and thinking that $100,000 equaled lifelong wealth.

Enter Roger Bannister. Roger is a medical student and a runner, but in no way is he superhuman. For years, he hears everyone saying that the 4-minute barrier is unbreakable. But guess what? He doesn’t buy it. Instead of thinking, “This is impossible, ” he thinks, “How can I do this?” Here’s where it gets exciting. Roger doesn’t just dream about it; he set his mind to break that barrier.

They’re likely to react quite defensively, like, “Whoa, why is this person telling me this?” They usually have a negative vibe about it, as if they’re thinking, “Oh great, this person thinks they can school me on this. ” They’re closed off, like they don’t need anybody’s two cents. Or when someone is rude to a person with a fixed mindset, they take the rudeness personally instead of realizing someone being rude is their own issue. And here’s why that’s such a bummer when you’re looking to grow.

They’re like, “Lay it on me! I want to get better!” They welcome the guidance with open arms because they know it’s only going to help their development. It’s the secret sauce that can help them step up their game. So, the takeaway here is pretty clear: Being open to criticism is key for growth.
