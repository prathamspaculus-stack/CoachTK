Once the plan is formulated, you can move to the next step with clarity. With a self-defined action plan to get where you want to be, you’ll create your own destiny. The chapters on mindset, habits, and rituals gave you plenty of action steps that you can use to transform dreams into reality. It’s truly quite profound. Manifestation is more than just a concept; it’s an empowering process that requires you to uplevel your thoughts, emotions, and actions to create the reality",

If you want to fast-track your career, consider moving from the IT team into what I’ d call the minor leagues, like working for an MSP or channel partner. And, when you aspire to join the major leagues later in your career, consider working for a manufacturer like Cisco, SolarWinds, Palo Alto Networks, or Zoom. Any tech company, usually originating from Silicon Valley, with tens of thousands of customers and employees, would be what I consider the major leagues.

However, it’s super important to talk about how the IT ecosystem grapples with several hurdles in tackling cybersecurity threats. One of the biggest challenges is the growing sophistication of threats. Cyber attackers now use an array of tactics such as social engineering, malware, and phishing, making the defense mechanism more complicated for IT professionals. Also, IT infrastructure itself has evolved to become exceed- ingly complex, with an array of interconnected devices.
