Similarly, when starting an IT career, it’s crucial to establish a solid foundation. This means acquainting yourself with the basic con - cepts of computer operations, gaining insights into high-level IT concepts, and starting out with an understanding of networking. Networking is the foundation to break into any technology sector. Once you learn networking, you can understand and specialize in other advanced technologies.
